# XR Project for the Musée des Arts Asiatiques de Nice

## Description

The **XR Project** is an immersive extended reality experience developed for the Musée des Arts Asiatiques de Nice. This project aims to enrich the visitor experience by enabling interactive engagement with the artworks in an immersive manner.

## Features

- **Virtual Tour:** Users can virtually walk through the museum and view artworks from various angles.
- **Interactive Information:** By clicking on an artwork, users can access detailed information about it.
- **Augmented Reality:** Users can see selected artworks in augmented reality, allowing them to explore in-depth details.

## Installation

To set up the XR Project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   \`\`\`

2. **Install Unreal Engine 4.26** with the Hololens option.

3. **Launch the Application:**  
   Open the project in Unreal Engine and start the simulation.

## Usage

Once the application is running, follow the on-screen instructions to navigate the museum and interact with the artworks.

## How the Project Works

Upon opening the project, you will arrive directly at the museum map. The artworks are arranged to match the original layout of the museum.

- **Displaying Widgets:** You can display a widget to view artworks by holding your left hand in front of your eyes and pressing the "Spawn" button with your right hand.

- **Voice-Activated Menu:** You can open a global menu via voice recognition by simply saying "Museum." This menu provides access to various tools.

- **Anchors:** You can add or remove anchors to map the museum and define the exact location of artworks.

- **AI Guide:** An AI guide is available to tour the museum. You can add steps by placing necessary points in the "MuseumPoint_BP."

> **Note:** Due to the limited memory of the Hololens, avoid adding too many assets or creating overly large projects, as this can complicate management.

## Quick Start Guide for Unreal Engine

This guide will help you quickly get acquainted with Unreal Engine (UE), one of the most powerful and versatile game engines available today. We will cover fundamental concepts such as Blueprint, GameMode, XR, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) using Behavior Trees (BT), Blackboard (BB), and Behavior Tree Tasks (BTT), essential elements for creating interactive and immersive games.

### What is Unreal Engine?

Unreal Engine is a game engine developed by Epic Games, used to create video games, simulations, architectural visualizations, and more. It offers advanced development tools, great flexibility, and outstanding visual quality.

### Blueprint (BP)

Blueprint is Unreal Engine's visual scripting system. It allows developers to create game logic, interactions, and behaviors without writing traditional code. With its intuitive drag-and-drop interface, Blueprint makes game development more accessible to artists and designers.

### GameMode (GM)

GameMode defines the basic rules and behavior of the game. It controls elements such as player interaction, score management, collision detection, and more. By modifying GameMode, you can fully customize the gameplay experience to meet your specific needs.

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)

AI is crucial for creating interactive and immersive games. Unreal Engine offers several tools for implementing complex AI behaviors, including:

- **Behavior Trees (BT):**  
  Behavior Trees are a modeling technique used to define the behavior of entities in a game. They provide a visual and hierarchical approach to describe actions characters can perform and the conditions that trigger those actions.

- **Behavior Tree Tasks (BTT):**  
  These are individual actions or tasks executed by AI-controlled entities within a Behavior Tree. Tasks can include moving to a position, attacking an enemy, or performing a specific animation.

- **Blackboard (BB):**  
  Blackboard is a data structure used to store relevant information and states for AI-controlled entities. It allows Behavior Trees to access and update this information in real-time, facilitating AI decision-making.

### XR (Extended Reality)

Unreal Engine supports Extended Reality (XR), encompassing Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and other immersive experiences. With Unreal Engine's built-in tools and features, you can create high-quality XR applications and experiences for various platforms, from VR headsets to mobile devices.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Unreal Engine:**  
   Download and install Unreal Engine from the [Epic Games website](https://www.unrealengine.com/).

2. **Create a Project:**  
   Launch the Unreal Engine Editor and create a new project by selecting a predefined template or starting from scratch.

3. **Explore the User Interface:**  
   Familiarize yourself with the Unreal Engine Editor's user interface, including scene views, tool panels, and menus.

4. **Learn the Basics of Blueprint:**  
   Explore tutorials and documentation on Blueprint to understand how to create game logic using this visual scripting system.

5. **Experiment with GameMode:**  
   Modify the default GameMode to understand its impact on gameplay and learn how to create your own custom GameMode.

6. **Dive into XR:**  
   If you're interested in VR or AR development, delve into XR-specific documentation to learn how to create immersive experiences.

This guide serves as a starting point to explore Unreal Engine's powerful features. Keep learning, experimenting, and creating to bring your game ideas to life!
